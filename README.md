#Income Prediction using different tree based methods

Knowledge of income of an individual may influence various companies to plan their future games accordingly. For instance, if a bank is interested in introducing a certain type of credit card or giving a certain kind of loan to a customer, it may interested in individuals having higher income segmemt. With this motivation I'm planning to build some tree based models due to its flexibility which predicts whether a person's income is less than 50,000 or greater than 50,000 based on certain features.
